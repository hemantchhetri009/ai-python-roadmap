# simple practice questions

# 1) 1 to 10 using both Loop 

# for loop
# for i in range(11):
#     print(i)

# while loop
# x = 1
# while x <= 10:
#     print(x)
#     x += 1     

# 2) Print “I love coding” 5 times. 

# for i in range(1,6):
#     print("i love coding", i)

# x = 1
# while x <= 5:
#     print("I Love Coding")
#     x += 1 

# 3) Print even numbers from 2 to 20. 


# for i in range(0, 21, 3):
#     print(i)

# for i in range(2 , 21):
#     if i%2 == 0:
#         print(i)

# while loop 

# x = 0
# while x <= 21:
#     print(x)
#     x += 3

# x = 2 
# while x <= 21:
#     if x % 2 == 0:
#         print(x)
#         x += 2


# 4) Print the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.

# total = 0
# for i in range(1, 101):
#     total += i
#     print(total)


# while Loop 

# x = 1
# while x <=  100:
#     print (x)
#     x += x


    
    
# Use a while loop to keep asking for a password until correct.

# x = "hemant"      
# n = input("enter password: ")
# while x != n:
#     print("invalid password")
#     n = input("enter again : ")
# print("login successful")    



# creating triangle using both while and for 

# x = "*"
# while len(x) <= 10:
#     print(x)
#     x += "*"


# for loop.

# for i in range(1, 6):
#     print("*" *i)
